# Who Is This Book For?

This book is for anyone who’s interested in ideas and examples to help build useful and entertaining chatbot interactions. While all of the examples in this book are in ==Ruby==, an experienced programmer can translate them into anylanguage.This book is equal parts entertainment, instruction, and inspiration. If you’renot a confident programmer, don’t worry. All of the code examples are testedand executable—you can download, run, and expand on these examples lateras needed.

# What’s in This Book?

This book has several sections. First, you’ll set up your own chatbot usingthe  Lita  framework  in  Ruby.  From  there,  you’ll  create  a  few  sample  botinteractions to get your feet wet. After that, you’ll deploy your new chatbot tothe internet so you can share it with friends. Along the way, you’ll learn howto integrate with external APIs, send messages, and perform sysadmin tasks,and how to connect to common “Internet of Things” devices.

# What You Need

You’ll need a computer that can run Ruby 2.0 or newer. You’ll also need aninternet connection so you can deploy your bots.What you won’t need, however, is lots of money—you can work through mostof the examples using free tools. Several others can be pulled off with freetrials and simulators from popular services.The  chatbot  skills  in  this  book  were  developed  on  a  MacBook  and  the  liveproduction bot was published to Linux servers. The Lita framework shouldwork pretty well for development in Windows, but you’ll have an easier timeon Linux, macOS, or even the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

this writing, Ruby and Lita do work on Windows, but many common Rubygems won’t work out-of-the-box unless you’re on a Unix-based system.

# Why Lita and Ruby?

I selected Lita for this book, because its design and licensing make it idealfor learning, training, and sharing. The project itself is open source, so you’llbe using it freely.The  way  Lita  provides  chat  skills—which  it  calls  handlers—is  great  forreadability, testability, and modularity. As you work through this book,you are going to make individual Lita skills that are publishable as well-tested, standalone Ruby gems.
